    "Design Python classes for a vehicle system with a base class Vehicle and child classes Car and Truck. Each class should have attributes for color, mileage, and fuel in liters. Implement a drive(km, km_per_liter) method that increments mileage and decreases fuel without letting it drop below zero, and a refuel(liters) method to add fuel. Show how inheritance avoids code duplication and include a method override in Truck (for example, with different fuel efficiency). Provide a minimal test script demonstrating these features, using classes versus instances, instance attributes and methods, and inheritance/overriding."

    "The program correctly converts temperatures in both directions and prints the results formatted to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lesson References: \n",
    "        This code demonstrates function definitions from Lesson Three ‚Äì Functions and Loops, input handling with input() and float() conversions, and conditional control flow from Lesson Four ‚Äì Conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations: \n",
    "The program does not handle invalid numeric inputs, so entering text instead of a number would raise a ValueError. Edge cases, like negative temperatures or very large values, are not explicitly tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Error Handling: \n",
    "Only invalid direction choices are handled; the numeric inputs are assumed valid, which could cause runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Faithfulness: \n",
    "The implementation uses functions and basic control flow correctly but lacks modularity, type hints, docstrings, and automated testing that were requested in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Improvement Opportunity: \n",
    "The code could be improved by adding type hints, docstrings, exception handling for numeric input, a main() function for CLI structure, and simple tests using assert to cover typical and edge cases."
